# Directus

We use [directus](https://directus.io/) as an API for our backend database. It comes with a lot of tools out of the box such as authentication and authorization.

After running the `directus` instance from `docker-compose.yml` you can access it [here](http://localhost:8055) and login with the generated username and password.
